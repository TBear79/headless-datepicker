# headless-datepicker
Provides the logic for a datepicker. Apply your own UI on top.

Provides the logic for creating a datepicker. No matter if you are preferring vanilla javascript, JQuery, Angular2, React or something else, you can easily make your own datepicker by applying headless-datepicker to provide the data.


* Easy to use and fast to implement
* Stable
* Very few dependencies
* Releaves you of the bore in programming your own datepicker logic

## Usage

### ES6 / Typescript

Use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the module:

```
	npm install rabbit-chatter
```

Then use it like this
``` javascript
	import { HeadlessDatepicker } from 'headless-datepicker'
```

### Vanilla

``` html
	<script type="javascript" src="headless-datepicker.js"></script>
```

```
	var headlessDatepicker = new HeadlessDatepicker
```

----------------------------- 












# Usage


Then use `require()` to load it in your code:

```javascript
	var rabbitChatter = require('rabbit-chatter');
```

Initialize a new instance:

```javascript
	var rabbit = rabbitChatter.rabbit(options);
```

And then you can send you message:

```javascript
	rabbit.chat('Got any carots?');
```

That's it! Of course you need to have RabbitMQ up and running for this to work.

If you haven't, I'll just provide a link to their homepage as a service to you: [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/).

## Options

You can of course provide options for setting up the transport in amqplib and for some extra stuff in rabbit-chatter.

### appId

String

Default: ''

A name for the application sends the message. Used in the receiving application to identify where the message came from.


### handleError

Function

Default: See below

A function for handling errors if it fails when sending the log to the queue.

The default function looks like this:
```javascript
	function(ex) {
		console.log('ERROR in rabbit-chatter: ' + util.inspect(ex, { depth: null }));
	}
```


### silent

Boolean

Default: false

If true, console-messages from rabbit-chatter will be suppressed. 


### protocol

String

Default: 'amqp'

The protocol used to communicate with RabbitMQ (or perhaps another message queue?).


### host

String

Default: 'localhost'

The URI of the server that hosts the RabbitMQ.


### virtualHost

String

Default: ''

Used if RabbitMQ is configured with a virtual host.


### port

Number

Default: 5672

The port that is open for connections to RabbitMQ.

### username

String

Default: 'guest'

Use this if credentials is required.


### password

String

Default: 'guest'

Use this if credentials is required.


### exchangeType

String

Default: 'topic'

The topic for the exchange.


### exchangeName

String

Default: ''

The name of the exchange. Leave empty and use routingKey in order to send to a specific queue no matter what exchange it's bound to.

### routingKey

String

Default: ''

The name of the queue to send the message to.

# Sending properties

It is possible to send properties along with the message. They are build into amqplib so you can get more knowledge here: [amqplib publish properties](http://www.squaremobius.net/amqp.node/channel_api.html#channel-publish)

That being said, rabbit-chatter sets some defaults in order to make things a bit easier.

### appId

String

Default: appId set on the instantiation.

The name of the sending application.


### correlationId

String

Default: a guid generated by node-uuid.

A guid for the recieving application to respond to.


### timestamp

Number

Default: milliseconds elapsed since 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC set with Date.now()


# Tests

To run tests on this module, make sure that the modules for the tests are installed

```
	npm install rabbit-chatter --dev
```

Then run:

```
	npm test
```

NOTICE: The test is not unit test but tests the functionality for submitting to RabbitMQ. So RabbitMQ is required to be installed locally in order to run the tests.
